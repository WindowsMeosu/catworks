<center><h1>catworks</h1></center>
<p>a site where whatever happens here, stays here (unless otherwise forced).</p>
<p>development started: July, 19 2023, hopes to be public sometime on 2024. (after that i'll just pretend that 2023 never even existed)</p>
<p>an attempt to create some an app for catworks is planned and hopes to be finished by 2026 or earlier. If it fails to be released by 2034... well it's basically never coming</p> 
<p>plans for 2028: rebrand the site and self-host it on a server or a linux distribution allowing user accounts. I plan to keep it open-source and the gh-page catworks (this) will be renamed to catworks-legacy or something.</p>
<p>anyway here's a partly-rushed monologue about catworks:</p>
<p>catworks plans to share cute images of cats, also cats, <s>make me feel alive so i have something to do by adding useless stuff to this page</s>, show snippets of almost every programming/markup/amiforgettingsomething language to exist, cats, piracy(kidding because otherwise i'll get sued and i'll be suffering from extreme debt til the end of time.), funny IRC conversations (just because i can), reviews on anything that can possibly exist, did i forget to mention cats?, promote useless information (like this) that makes you wish you regret even visiting this site (also like this), oh and cats.</p>
<p>I know you're probably starting to regret your decision to read all of that or even visit this site... well assuming you are still interested for more eye-wrenching content, I suggest visiting this site once a while to see what has changed. I'll just end it here before I get a bounty issued to my head, farewell! </p>
